    <p class="text-white"> Jinja is a fast, expressive, extensible templating engine. Special placeholders in the template allow writing
        code similar to Python syntax. Then the template is passed data to render the final document.
    </p>
    <p class="text-white">Jinja uses a central object called the template Environment. Instances of this class are used to store the
        configuration and global objects, and are used to load templates from the file system or other locations. Even
        if you are creating templates from strings by using the constructor of Template class, an environment is created
        automatically for you, albeit a shared one.</p>
